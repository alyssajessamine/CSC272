Objects and classes are both very important concepts when it comes to programing in Java. A class is responsible for creating a template, or a path way to allow for other components such as objects. A class sets the baseline for the program. However, an object is one of many components which makes up the classes. Theses components, specifically an object create specific instances or values of the previously defined classes. Therefore, a class provides a generalized coded structure as well as defines the behaviors of an object, while an object is each unique instance produced by the class.
